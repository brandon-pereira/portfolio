# Brandon's Portfolio

## About

My portfolio as hosted at [branclon.com](http://www.branclon.com). My portfolio is to help you learn a little bit about me, showcase my projects, demonstrate my skills, and provide you with ways to contact me.

## Setup

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm start
```

## Technical Features

This repo utilizes several features including:

- 🍦 Powered by Vanilla Javascript and homemade static site generation
- 📦 Leverages Parcel for a super light-weight build server
- 🎹 Content Management powered by Contentful
- 🧪 Tests which verify site will function properly with the provided data from CMS
- 🚀 Zero Client Side Dependencies ([except my own package](https://github.com/brandon-pereira/scroll-text))
- 🤓 Uses TypeScript to reduce bugs and improve code satisfaction
- 🎼 Leverages GitHub actions for automated production deploys and testing

## Contribute

This repo is one of my playgrounds to learn, so contributions aren't needed. However, if you like the setup, feel free to fork and use this as a base... but send me a link so I can see!
