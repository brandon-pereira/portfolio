		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<h3>Hi, I'm Brandon.</h3>
		<p>I’m a full stack developer specializing in front-end web development. I currently live in Calgary, Alberta and employed by <a href="http://www.criticalmass.com/" target="_blank">Critical Mass</a>. I graduated from <a href="http://www.sait.ca" target="_blank">SAIT Polytechnic</a> with a diploma in <a href="http://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/full-time-studies/certificates/object-oriented-software-developer-course-overview.php" target="_blank">object-oriented software development</a> and achieved several awards for exceptional grades. I have a passion for programming, and have been programming since 2006.</p>

		<h3>What I'm up to</h3>
		<p>Currently I’m working full time as a front-end web developer. On top of this, I’m also contributing to open source projects and working on expanding my knowledge with the whole web experience (particularly all the Javascript things). I am also available for hire with small to medium sized projects which I can contribute to on top of my current workload.</p>
