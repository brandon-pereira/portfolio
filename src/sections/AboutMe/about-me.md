### Professional Journey

With a career spanning several years, I've not only led teams of engineers but also overseen projects from inception to completion, effectively managing technical debt, infrastructure, and documentation. Additionally, I'm well-versed in the intricacies of technical hiring, onboarding, and offboarding.

I'm a proud graduate with honors from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), and my journey in programming began in 2006. As a Canadian citizen, I'm currently dedicated to my role as the Head of Engineering at Wreno, where I'm instrumental in driving technical excellence.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply involved in the tech community. You'll find me contributing to open-source projects on GitHub, volunteering at the Calgary Public Libraries Coder Dojo program, and actively participating in web and software development meetups.

### Personal Insights

On a personal note, I'm happily married to my wife Emma. Together, we share our home with Astro, an aptly named dog inspired by my passion for software development. Our feline friend, Moomies, is a cherished rescue. We call the vibrant city of Calgary, Alberta, our home.

Beyond the screen, I find joy in woodwork, gaming, hiking, skiing, pedal biking, and exploring personal finance strategies. I believe in a holistic approach to life, where professional growth and personal interests come together seamlessly.
