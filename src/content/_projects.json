It goes through GulpJS to create production (minified) files as well as enabling live reload on both front-end and back-end (running on same instance). The back-end is written in NodeJS (using Express to handle server portion) and utilizes a REST API. For a database I decided to use MongoDB.</p>\n<p>The hosting is being provided by DigitalOcean. For this project I created a basic linux server and manually implemented NodeJS, Mongo, Git, and NGINX.
