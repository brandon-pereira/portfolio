We had 4 months to rebuild the Nissan USA and Infiniti USA websites. This was a great opportunity to develop and demonstrate time-management skills, planning, and teamwork.

We built the system using a style guide, which allowed us to easily reuse components throughout the website. My team of 4 took on the configurator and applications. My main contributions involved building configurator. This required several technical deliverables such as building page controllers on both server and client side (Java, GSP, Javascript), modifying the styleguide internal workings (GulpJS), and building responsive components (FoundationJS, Javascript, SCSS). Nearly all components in the configurator were built or modified by me.
