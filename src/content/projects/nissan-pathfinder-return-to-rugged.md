Our team had the opportunity to work on a modern campaign for our Nissan client. We utilized several modern tools like ThreeJS, Gatsby, and ReactJS. These tools allowed us to deliver an immersive and impressive experience to users.

My role on the project mainly focused on architecture and leadership. 

My responsibilities included: 
- Getting the concept debriefing from our client and creative teams
- Building out a solution design and architecture for the site
- Onboarding, problem-solving, reviewing pull requests, debugging issues as they arose, and doing minor features where I could.
- I also helped manage risks as they arose, which meant working with clients and other departments on workarounds and solutions to challenges.
- Lastly, I was responsible for demoing the experience to our client and gathering client feedback.

We were able to launch on time with the clients very impressed. We also expanded the project scope to create a Canadian version. The Canadian site was launched a few months after the US site.
