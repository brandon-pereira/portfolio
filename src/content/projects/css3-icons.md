When I was still in school, I loved dabbling with CSS. I would build whole applications interfaces just for fun. One day, I saw someone recreate iOS icons using CSS. I was inspired.

I decided to do the same, so I built some icons in pure CSS3. I loved them. A couple of years later, after I was working professionally, I decided to tweak them to use SCSS. After I did this, I published them to GitHub for others to play with.
