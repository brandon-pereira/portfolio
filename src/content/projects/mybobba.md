[Habbo](http://habbo.com/) is a popular online world for teenagers. During my younger teenage years, I built a fansite for the game which allowed users to upload pictures of themselves and have unmoderated chat. It got very popular with about 1k hits a day. Unfortunately, I couldn't afford the bandwidth and had to close its doors.
