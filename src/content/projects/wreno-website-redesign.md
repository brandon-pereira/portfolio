In early 2023, Wreno made the strategic decision to pivot into a new market. Previously, we were building a solution to connect contractors with property managers.

The task of re-branding the website may seem simple, but it was a project running in parallel to us [rebuilding our entire product from scratch](wreno-vendorease), so we had limited resources for the rebranding. We chose to outsource the rebranding and have our internal team focus on the product rebuild.

I managed hiring a contractor to assist in this development while also building out tickets and a project scope in our ticketing software. As part of this, I also made it a priority to integrate this website into our existing frontend monorepo. This ensured we had a unified codebase for our frontend web engineers to manage, leveraging our existing component library (managed through Storybook and Chromatic) to re-use our existing buttons, inputs, etc., and simultaneously re-skin our product and website.

Additionally, we opted to utilize [Builder.io](https://builder.io). This enabled our non-technical team to create new pages and manage website content without relying on our engineers for coding and deployment.

Finally, we prioritized enhancing the website's performance, SEO, and accessibility, achieving a perfect score of 100/100 in all categories according to Lighthouse Labs.
