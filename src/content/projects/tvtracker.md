TvTracker is an application for tracking your TV Shows. It was built to work great on mobile, desktop, and even from your status bar (Mac). It has a login system, providing the ability to sync your shows across all devices as well as providing push notifications when your favourite shows air. 

Under the hood we're using React and MobX, Webpack for compiling and code splitting, Service Workers for offline caching and push notifications, and Electron for building the Mac app. We also utilize Express for providing a GraphQL API, User Login system, and push notifications to devices.
