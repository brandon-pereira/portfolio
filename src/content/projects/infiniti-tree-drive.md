I built a reveal page for Infinitis winter sales event. For each test drive, they planted a tree in America.

This project was very creative heavy and required me to work closely with designers. I took their PSD and built the page around it. As a bonus, we built an SVG of the states, converted it into several polygons, and then animated the individual polygons. The result is a beautiful animation when navigating the page.

See the video below for an example of this animation.
