My team and I were tasked to rebuild the FirstCommand website to be more modern. We got a blank slate, so we got to take advantage of the latest technologies.

We leveraged Gatsby for our build system. Gatsby uses GraphQL under the hood, so I also got additional exposure to that. On the front end, we used React. The project included a couple of unusual challenges including WYSIWYG to React component parsing and static site generation. I was also tasked with tagging the website for Google Tag Manager, so I had to work closely with our marketing science team.
