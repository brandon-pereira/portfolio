I was tasked with rebuilding the Nissan and Infiniti Recalls tools to comply with their new brand guidelines. I took the opportunity to improve the responsiveness, appearance, and codebase.

The timeline was short, so I got some exposure to working on an accelerated timeline. This forced me to prioritize functionality in some areas but helped me to practice my decision making.
