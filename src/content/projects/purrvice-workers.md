A web application for getting random cat pictures. Powered by service workers. It demonstrates offline caching, web push notifications, and progressive enhancement. 

The project was built for a tech-talk for Critical Mass. A tech-talk is a presentation in front of the technology department where we can present on a topic of our choosing.  In this way, not only did I get to experiment with service workers but I also got to practice my presentation skills.
