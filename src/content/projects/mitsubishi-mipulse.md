Our company was tasked with building a new global website for Mitsubishi. The goal was to make it run in every market but share single source code. My goal was to focus on performance and making the application render more quickly. 

From a technical perspective, I improved performance through several factors. These include: improving the GraphQL server caching, improving the React hydration process, reducing the size of the HTML pages, and rendering the app through a stream rather than returning a string.

The project was managed from Toronto which meant I needed to work remotely. As such, I had to focus on managing my time and communication skills to accommodate the remote environment. I did this mainly by leveraging Slack text and video calls. 

The project has successfully launched in the Netherlands, and they're hoping to have more regions launch soon.
