I built a contact form and information website for a local mortgage broker. This one was pretty quick and easy to build, and I tried to do it quickly and affordably for my client. Overall, they loved the work.

One thing I did on this project that differed from my usual implementation, is I leveraged Netlify to manage the deploys, DNS resolutions, and contact form submissions.
