I was contacted by the owner to aid in a new campaign that he had. His idea was to partner with local radio stations and have them compete over the best radio station. I aided in this promotion by developing a website allowing users to vote on their favourite radio station. I also had allowed administrators to view poll results in real-time.

By the end of the 2-week campaign, we had received over 30,000 total votes!
