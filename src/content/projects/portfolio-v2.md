I built this portfolio from scratch to showcase my experience with web technologies. I wanted to build a system which was easily maintainable, responsive and used some fun next-level technologies.

This portfolio was built using KnockoutJS (try filtering these projects from the header or from a skills accordion), JSON for storing content (this information and more is coming from an ajax request), Gulp for minifying code; compressing images; enabling live reload; and more. It also contains some fun front-end features. The header of this page is using filters to alter the hue and is multiplying the background-image with the background-gradient to create a unique effect.

Make sure you're on an up-to-date browser for best results.
