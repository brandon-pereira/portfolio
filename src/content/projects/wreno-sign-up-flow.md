The sign-up flow was my first contribution to Wreno after joining the company. When I joined, the company only had a simple static site. During this project, I lead the development of the sign-up flow. My role included hiring, gathering business requirements, and designing the database and backend services for storing users' accounts, file uploads, and data.

On top of launching this flow, we also used this opportunity to migrate a lot of the files over to Typescript, begin a migration to an internal style guide for re-usable components,  and implementing server-side rendering by moving from Create React App to NextJS.

We had many more products in the roadmap, so this was only one small contribution to my overall workload.
