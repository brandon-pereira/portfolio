I was hired to build a website for a roofing company based in Chicago. We began with no domain, designs, or branding, except for a defined color palette. I guided our team through the design iteration, implementation, bug fixing, and rollout. From a technical standpoint, I handled everything, from selecting the appropriate tech stack and hosting platform to managing DNS records and other technical details.

The project was highly successful. It played a pivotal role in significantly enhancing their online presence, introducing a user-friendly lead generator, and providing potential clients with the ability to receive a quote within minutes (via a third-party web embed).

After a few months, they approached me for assistance in building a blog for their website. Given that I had already established a robust design system, I opted to construct the blog using a new tool called [Builder.io](https://builder.io). This tool enabled me to manage the blog in React, offering them a WYSIWYG editing experience. This not only helped us keep costs down but also provided an exceptional authoring experience while allowing us to swiftly elevate our SEO efforts.
