I was hired to build a website for a roofing company based in Chicago. We started off with no domain, designs, or branding besides a color palette. I helped our team through the design iteration, implementation, bug fixing, and rollout. I managed everything from a technical perspective, including picking an appropriate tech stack, hosting platform, and managing DNS records and details.

The project was very successful. It helped them drastically improve their online presence, introduced a convenient lead generator, and a way for their potential clients to get a quote within minutes (through third-party web embed).

After few months, they reached out for assistance building a blog for their website. Since I had already built out the design system, I chose to build the blog in a new tool called [Builder.io](https://builder.io). This tool allowed me to manage the blog in React, and give them a WYSIWYG editing experience. This allowed us to keep the costs low, deliver an amazing authoring experience, and let us improve our SEO game further quickly.
