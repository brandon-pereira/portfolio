As the Head of Engineering at Wreno, spearheading the launch of VendorEase was a thrilling endeavor that showcased the agility and innovation inherent in startup life.

## Project Overview

VendorEase, a bold pivot for Wreno, addresses the challenges of managing contractor compliance. In just over three months, we created a powerful software solution. It collects and organizes diverse contractor documents, streamlining compliance for property managers overseeing staff like plumbers and electricians. Additionally, we integrated a search tool, leveraging scraped data from 400,000 vendors on the internet. This tool allows property managers not only to manage their existing contractors efficiently but also to discover and connect with new ones. The result? Positive client feedback and rapid growth.

## Technical Overview

Our tech stack—React, Node, TypeScript, Postgres (with ORM Sequelize), Styled Components, and Storybook—formed a robust foundation. As the leader focusing on backend and DevOps, I ensured a secure and scalable infrastructure. DevOps initiatives included implementing CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment and continuous integration, setting the stage for future scaling. While backend was my primary focus, I actively contributed to frontend development and design, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.

## Roles and Responsibilities

In this dynamic environment, I played a multifaceted role. Leading a team of engineers, I planned technical requirements, focusing on backend and DevOps. Active contributions extended to frontend development and design. Additionally, my involvement in product management and planning ensured that technical decisions aligned with strategic business goals. This comprehensive engagement allowed for a well-rounded contribution to VendorEase's success.

The positive client response marks just the beginning of VendorEase's journey, affirming Wreno's commitment to innovation and problem-solving in the realm of contractor management.
