I built a simple Messenger bot that gives you the Urban Dictionary definition of a word. The idea was simple, and I only gave myself 4 hours to go from creating the repository to having it running in production.

I've done several chatbots already in the past, so this one was fairly similar. However, this one was done for a personal project, whereas the others are usually done for a client.

Overall, the project was a success. However, because of the Cambridge Analytica hacks on Facebook, they have recently tweaked the app-review process for Messenger apps, which has made it more difficult to keep the app live.
