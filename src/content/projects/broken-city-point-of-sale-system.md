For our capstone project at SAIT four of us developed a point of sale system for Broken City. We put an emphasis on speed, ease of use, and modern design. 

We had four positions to fill. Two were in charge of Java development, one was database design and schema development and lastly was the front-end developer.  I already had solid front-end development knowledge (as I had already doing front-end on the side) so I naturally took this role. 

My job was to create a method for communicating with the Java server as well as designing the interface for the system. This included writing JSPs for rendering the HTML, building the CSS (we used LESS), and lastly using jQuery and Ajax for communicating with the server.

We received multiple compliments on our design as well as an outstanding grade. One of my professors also liked my work enough to refer me for a position at Critical Mass, which was my first software development job.
