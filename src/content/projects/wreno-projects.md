## Project Overview

At Wreno, I helped launch the Projects feature. A powerful new way for property managers to find, evaluate, and connect with vendors. The product introduced several major features: vendor chat, AI-powered comparative analysis, and intelligent vendor matching. The goal was to remove friction from the vendor selection process and provide property managers with better tools to make faster, more informed decisions. This feature is now live and being used by real estate teams across North America.

Some of the key successes include:

- Vendors had a **84% response rate** to project requests.
- The AI comparative analysis tool **reduced the time spent on vendor selection by 50%**.
- The vendor chat system improved communication efficiency, leading to **faster project completion times**.

## Technical Overview

We built the Projects section using **NodeJS, React, Postgres, and Typescript**. The architecture had to support complex data relationships, real-time messaging, and machine learning insights—all while keeping the experience responsive and intuitive.

### AI Analysis

One of the standout components was our **AI comparative analysis** tool. I implemented a custom scoring system that evaluated vendor proposals across key dimensions like cost, quality, clarity, and historical performance. This system helped users cut decision-making time in half by surfacing clear, data-backed recommendations.

### Vendor Chat

We used **Firebase Firestore** to power real-time chat between vendors and property managers. I integrated rich media support (files, images, structured forms) and ensured the UI stayed performant even under heavy load. This gave users a fluid, modern chat experience that improved project communication and accountability.

### Vendor Matches

The **vendor matching algorithm** combined user preferences with vendor attributes like availability, certifications, past ratings, and geographic reach. This feature helped drive an 84% vendor response rate—an early sign of strong product-market fit.

## Roles and Responsibilities

As a full-stack engineer, I led the development of the entire Projects section. I handled backend service design, database modeling, frontend component architecture, and AI tool integration. I collaborated closely with design to fine-tune usability and worked with QA to ensure a clean, stable release. This project pushed both the technical complexity and user impact I aim for in product work.
