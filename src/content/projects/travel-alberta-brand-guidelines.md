I built the internal brand guidelines website for Travel Alberta. This project had a clean state so I got to choose my own tech stack. I put a lot of effort into making the website load as fast as possible as well as look pixel perfect.

I ended up using Gulp for CSS, assets, etc. alongside Webpack for my javascript.  I got to leverage tons of webpack features like code-splitting, hot-module reloading, as well as ES6 classes and syntax.  From a CSS perspective, I built the layout using flexbox and other CSS3 features. The experience is gated, but check out the login screen for an example of how fast the website loads.
