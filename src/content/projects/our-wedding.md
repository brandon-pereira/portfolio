I built my now Wife and I's Wedding website from scratch. I wanted our guests to RSVP, list dietary restrictions, and learn about our big. I thought it might be helpful to build an admin panel to manage guests, message guests, and provide a quick, glanceable current guest list count.

One fun feature I had to build was the ability to change a wedding date. We had to add this because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced us to re-send invitations. During re-coding this, I thought it might be helpful to build an admin panel to manage guests which led me down the building and re-building of an email feature. Originally, I built it using nodemailer through Gmail but that was going into guests' spam folders frequently. I decided to then switch to using Amazon SES which worked much better.

I later modularized the whole wedding backend and published it to NPM. I figured it may be helpful to share this with others who plan to get married in the future.
