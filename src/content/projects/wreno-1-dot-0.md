I was the first technical hire for Wreno. I was hired as a technical lead, but quickly they felt that I was over-qualified and would be a great fit as the Director of Engineering.

When I joined, they had no technical infrastructure setup. They had a website built by a contractor hosted in AWS, but otherwise they had no tech established. They were leveraging several third-party tools and connecting them together to establish a end-to-end solution, but they were increasingly running into scaling issues that were quickly eating into their margins.

My first immediate task was to work with the two founders and a designer and iterate on what their product would look like. This included what features were feasible for an MVP, ensuring we planned ahead and considered future feature requests, and ensuring we could launch something within 6 months (to resolve the scaling issues). The first month mainly consisted of me strategizing on a tech stack, planning the database design, and building out a detailed estimate and scope of work.

Once we had reached a concrete set of requirements and timeline, we needed to hire. I had to hire 5 frontend Web-React engineers, 1 backend engineer, and 3 React Native engineers. This took a considerable amount of time, but with each hire, our velocity was increased significantly. Having lots of experience scaling teams, this wasn't the hardest part, as I knew how to focus the engineers to avoid overlapping and duplicating work.

After 6 months, as planned, we had fully finished development of the MVP, including testing and bug fixing. This alone was a huge feat, but by this time we were now onto the next challenge which was migrating all our users off the existing app onto our in house app. This consisted of several internal trials with power users to test our email campaigns, aided guides, and support to help report/resolve any gaps in the migration.

After another 2 months, all users of our app were successfully migrated and we had also simultaneously shipped several new features to expand the apps capabilities.

I am very proud of this project, as it's the largest product I single handedly managed from a technical perspective start to finish. We have since hired a few more technical leads who have helped shepard and grow the product, all building off my original plans.
