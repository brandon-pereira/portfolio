My company redesigned and built a new shopping tools experience for Nissan and Infiniti. The shopping tools experience includes the configurator (building a vehicle and choosing your colors, options, etc.), the payment estimator (calculate your lease/finance payments) and the inventory tool for finding similar inventory near you.

This was my first major project with the role of Technology Lead. This meant that my main responsibilities were initially to estimate the scope and prototype and implement a proof of concept. Once these two tasks were complete, we then moved into development where I helped a team of twelve developers by assigning and delegating tickets, helping debug issues that arose, managing client expectations, working with our creative and user experience teams to build the best product possible, and much more.

The project was built using React on the front-end, and GraphQL on the backend. We also used Lerna and Storybook to manage versioning and managing our internal styleguide. I was fully involved in all aspects of this project, from working with designers to debugging production issues, and everything in between. 

This project was massive and took about 2 years to fully complete and launch. It might not seem like a lot from a glance, but there is a lot of functionality in these tools.
