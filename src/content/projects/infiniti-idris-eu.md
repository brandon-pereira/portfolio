After a successful launch of our first Idris project for North America, the client asked if we could add more functionality and launch it in the European Union. 

After reviewing feedback and user inputs from the North American project, we found there were several things we could improve upon. These included:

- Ability to compare models
- Ability to find Infiniti dealers near your location
- Ability to recommend a car based on your driving style
- Make platform GDPR compliant

Aside from implementing the requested features, I also took the opportunity to improve our chatbot framework which we use under the hood. 

This project was a tremendous success for the client. We hope it will pave the way for similar projects down the road.
