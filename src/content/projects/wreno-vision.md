## Project Overview

As Head of Engineering at Wreno, I led the development of a suite of AI-powered APIs designed to give developers secure, scalable access to our internal AI capabilities. This was a greenfield opportunity to build a modern API platform from scratch, enabling use cases such as document reading, validation, and verification. The result was a unified developer experience, capable of powering AI integrations across real estate, insurance, and operations workflows.

## Technical Overview

We designed our API platform with performance, flexibility, and maintainability in mind. I led the design and implementation of the entire backend architecture using a modern stack.

### Open API

I built the OpenAPI 3.0-compliant server using [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a blazing-fast web framework. I defined endpoint contracts, enforced strict type safety with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and leveraged [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) for interactive documentation, including markdown support and autogenerated OpenAPI references. The system was backed by [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) via [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), supported by [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/) for distributed job queues, and cached with [Redis](https://redis.io/). Testing and CI were powered by [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), enabling fast, reliable test cycles across services.

### Vision AI API

The Vision AI API extracts structured data from uploaded documents. It supports:

- **Validation**: Authenticity, format, and forgery checks
- **Classification**: Automatic document type detection
- **Extraction**: Key data and metadata parsing
- **Confidence Scoring**: Probabilistic confidence thresholds for downstream systems

### Verification AI APIs

We built three primary verification modes to handle real-world document authenticity checks:

#### Web Crawling Verification

For documents containing source URLs, I built a headless browser system (using Google Cloud Run Jobs) to dynamically load and interact with poorly structured or JS-heavy pages. We used OpenAIâ€™s computer use tools to navigate, click, and extract page data for comparison.

#### Automated Email AI Verification

To automate third-party confirmation, I built a document-driven agent system that generates email identities, sends context-aware verification messages, and manages thread responses. I added smart retries, escalation logic, and even built a full internal React email client to support human follow-up.

#### API-Based Verification

For known document types with supported APIs, we made secure, programmatic verification calls and matched results against document contents. This allowed for fast, reliable authentication using authoritative sources.

As Head of Engineering at Wreno, I led the development of a suite of AI APIs designed to help developers easily integrate our AI capabilities into their applications. The APIs include Vision AI (Reading Documents), Verification AI (Verifying the Documents Authenticity), and more.

## Roles and Responsibilities

As Head of Engineering, I owned the end-to-end technical vision and execution for this platform. I architected the system from the ground up, designed and implemented core APIs, and ensured type-safe, maintainable code using modern TypeScript tooling. I led backend and infrastructure work, including OpenAPI contract design, async job processing, browser-based crawling systems, and AI pipeline integration.

I also built internal tooling to support operational teams, such as an email-based verification agent system and a React-based escalation dashboard. Beyond coding, I mentored engineers, established our testing and deployment standards, and worked closely with product and operations to translate domain-specific problems into scalable technical solutions.

## Impact

- We decreased document processing times by ~85% through automatically reading and validating documents.
- Our verification APIs reduced manual review workloads by 90% by automating third-party confirmations.
- The platform enabled rapid development of AI-powered features across multiple business units, including real estate, insurance, and operations.
- We achieved 99.9% uptime and reliability, with robust error handling and monitoring in place.
- The OpenAPI documentation and interactive examples significantly improved developer onboarding and adoption.
