**Note:** We recently shut off the wings.cheap app due to server upgrades. You can still view the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/brandon-pereira/wings-cheap).

I built a web app for finding cheap wings near you. It allows you to sort by city, price, distance, or by the best wings. Give it a shot the next time you're looking for a cheap eat!
