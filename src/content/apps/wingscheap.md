__Note:__ We recently shut off the wings.cheap domain name and are now using [branclon.com/wings-cheap/](https://branclon.com/wings-cheap/). Sorry for any  inconvenience! 

I built a web app for finding cheap wings near you. It allows you to sort by city, price, distance, or by the best wings. Give it a shot the next time you're looking for a cheap eat!
