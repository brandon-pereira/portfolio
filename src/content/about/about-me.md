## About Me

I’m a full-stack developer specializing in front-end web development. I currently live in Calgary, Alberta and am employed by [Wreno](https://www.wreno.io/). With several years of experience, I have gained a very strong understanding of technical skills as well as managerial skills. I graduated from [SAIT Polytechnic](https://www.sait.ca/) with a diploma in object-oriented software development and achieved several awards for exceptional grades. I have a passion for programming and have been programming since 2006.

### What I'm up to

Currently I’m working full-time as a Director of Engineering. On top of this, I’m also contributing to [open source projects](https://github.com/brandon-pereira), volunteering at the [Calgary Public Libraries](https://calgarylibrary.ca/) Coder Dojo program, and attending/hosting Meetups related to web and software development.
