Critical Mass was hired to help with that.</p><p>Blueshield uses a unique CMS which requires each page to be built with custom elements. Rather than us manually coding in these elements, we thought it would be a smart to automate some of the tedious work. We built a templating system which allowed us to both QA our pages with dummy content, as well as deliver the pages with these transformed elements.</p><p>On top of this, I also flew to California a couple of times to help their team build their pages. This required me to mentor some of their web developers, communicate/strategize with their tech leads, and help solve some problems they were facing.</p>",

My team of 4 took on the configurator and applications. My main contributions involved building configurator. This required several technical deliverables such as building page controllers on both server and client side (Java, GSP, Javascript), modifying the styleguide internal workings (GulpJS), and building responsive components (FoundationJS, Javascript, SCSS). Nearly all components in the configurator were built or modified by me.</p><p>Check out the configurator here: <a href='http://nissanusa.com/buildyournissan/' target='_blank'>Nissan</a> | <a href='http://infinitiusa.com/buildyourinfiniti' target='_blank'>Infiniti</a> <i>(you currently can only access on mobile)</i></p>",
