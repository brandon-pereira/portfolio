    "description": "<p>I worked with a local entrepreneur to develop a digital wall calendar. He wanted to be able to have a wall-mounted touch-screen monitor that could display current calendar events from multiple Google accounts. </p>\n<p>From a hardware perspective, I learned a lot on this project. All I knew when I started was that it was an Android tablet. I didn&#39;t know anything about how Kiosk mode or Android Launchers. These two features are essential for taking an Android APK and locking it as the only usable application. This project was a real opportunity for me to experiment with writing native bindings for a Cordova based application. I also explored using React Native for this project, but we ran into a couple of limitations early on that have since been resolved.</p>\n<p>On the backend, I also learned a lot. I had experience with managing OAuth Tokens, but this project expanded that knowledge. I learned a lot about implementing OAuth at a lower level (rather than using a library), managing and leveraging refresh tokens, and managing user sessions on the front-end. For this project, I also leveraged Apollo Server to manage the front-end queries, which is something I&#39;ve had a ton of experience with previously, so it was an easy grab to keep the project moving quickly.</p>\n<p>On the front-end, this was a fun project to build. I&#39;ve always found calendar interfaces pretty complex. There are conflicts (multiple overlapping events), supporting multiple users and calendars, and recurring/all-day events. I felt the solution I implemented for this worked well and scaled as we added other features. Aside from the calendar itself, it was also enjoyable to build UI interfaces commonly reserved for the operating system (Wi-Fi selection, Brightness Sliders, Sleep Schedules, etc.) </p>\n<p>I took on this contracting position at the peak of COVID-19, so it was nice to have something to keep me occupied during the lockdown. I look forward to seeing how this project evolves. </p>\n",

This meant that my main responsibilities were initially to estimate the scope and prototype and implement a proof of concept. Once these two tasks were complete, we then moved into development where I helped a team of twelve developers by assigning and delegating tickets, helping debug issues that arose, managing client expectations, working with our creative and user experience teams to build the best product possible, and much more.</p>\n<p>The project was built using React on the front-end, and GraphQL on the backend. We also used Lerna and Storybook to manage versioning and managing our internal styleguide. I was fully involved in all aspects of this project, from working with designers to debugging production issues, and everything in between. </p>\n<p>This project was massive and took about 2 years to fully complete and launch. It might not seem like a lot from a glance, but there is a lot of functionality in these tools.  </p>\n",

My goal was to focus on performance and making the application render more quickly. </p>\n<p>From a technical perspective, I improved performance through several factors. These include: improving the GraphQL server caching, improving the React hydration process, reducing the size of the HTML pages, and rendering the app through a stream rather than returning a string.</p>\n<p>The project was managed from Toronto which meant I needed to work remotely. As such, I had to focus on managing my time and communication skills to accommodate the remote environment. I did this mainly by leveraging Slack text and video calls. </p>\n<p>The project has successfully launched in the Netherlands, and they&#39;re hoping to have more regions launch soon.</p>\n",

Critical Mass was hired to help with that.</p>\n<p>Blue Shield uses a unique CMS which requires each page to be built with custom elements. Rather than us manually coding in these elements, we thought it would be smart to automate some of the tedious work. We built a templating system which allowed us to both QA our pages with dummy content, as well as deliver the pages with these transformed elements.</p>\n<p>On top of this, I also flew to California a couple of times to help their team build their pages. This required me to mentor some of their web developers, communicate/strategize with their tech leads, and help solve some problems they were facing.</p>\n",

This was a great opportunity to develop and demonstrate time-management skills, planning, and teamwork.</p>\n<p>We built the system using a style guide, which allowed us to easily reuse components throughout the website. My team of 4 took on the configurator and applications. My main contributions involved building configurator. This required several technical deliverables such as building page controllers on both server and client side (Java, GSP, Javascript), modifying the styleguide internal workings (GulpJS), and building responsive components (FoundationJS, Javascript, SCSS). Nearly all components in the configurator were built or modified by me.</p>\n<p>Check out the configurator here: <a href=\"http://nissanusa.com/buildyournissan/\">Nissan</a> | <a href=\"http://infinitiusa.com/buildyourinfiniti\">Infiniti</a> <em>(you currently can only access on mobile)</em></p>\n",
